# Bison_Element_Models
R code and Stan code for statistical models of bison element frequencies in Early Holocene archaeological contexts.

This is a work in progress, please feel free to notify me of any errors or to make suggestions. Currently, this project is tailored to
modelling bison element frequencies in Early Holocene archaeological contexts in North America, but, in principle, it could be 
extended to any spatiotemporal context where differential carcass transport decisions are of archaeological interest. Current features
of the code are specific to the bison dataset, but I hope to make this more generalizeable for other contexts in the future.

<b>DATA</b><br><br>
<b>MNE_Data.csv:</b> This sheet contains the archaeological data of interest. Rows are individual site components, containing MNE data and other component specific information, such as site type, element counts, and reference information. Also, note, one row contains information for anatomical frequencies rather than component specific information. There is additional information in this spreadsheet that is not used in the current R or Stan code that I intend to build into other models. Also, note components from later assemblages that are not used in the current models. Currently the R code excludes these components from the models, but in the future, I intend to exand this model beyond Early Holocene contexts.<br><br>
<b>Utility_Data.csv:</b> This sheet contains data from Emerson's (1990) disseration work on the dietary utility of bison carcass portions. There is a column of data for each individual animal that Emerson analyzed. The dietary utility indexes in this sheet include grease utility (GRE), total fat utility (TF_), select fat utility (SF_), skeletal fat utility (SKF), marrow utility (MAR), protein/meat utility (PRO), and total products utility (TP_).<br><br>
<b>Density_Data.csv:</b> This sheet contains data from Kreutzer's (1992) dissertation work on the volume density of scan site locations on bison elements.<br><br>
<b>AdjDensity_Data.csv</b> This sheet contains data from Lam et al.'s (1999) study of CT density values on element scan sites from numerous taxa. Specifically, this sheet contains their data from wildebeest. Their study demonstrated that earlier density measurements used by zooarchaeologists frequently underestimated the density values of elements with voids (e.g., the marrow cavities of long bones). This includes Kreutzer's data. Lam et al. (1999) provide density values for elements both with and without consideration for internal voids. As such, I use these values to provide a rough correction for Kreutzer's bison data, rescaling values for those elements so that their densities are not underestimated. Since Lam et al. (1999) did not measure bison, I used their wildebeest data, as they are likely to be most comparable to the bison data since both animals are bovids (the relative differences between values incorporating voids and those excluding voids are likely to be more similar between bison and wildebeest than they are to be between bison and any other taxon in Lam et al.'s study).
