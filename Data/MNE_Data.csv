A line segment for 'pelvis' was interpreted as two innominates for each articulated pelvic unit. For long bones, non-overlapping segments indicating proximal/distal portions were accounted for (i.e., only the portion with the greatest number of segments was included in MNE counts). For tarsals/carpals, the MNE for each unit was obtained by adding the most abundant carpal/tarsal from each anatomical side. For disarticulated cranial portions, MNE was obtained using the most abundant portion, accounting for side (i.e., 14 right petrous portions). For disarticulated ribs, counts of complete elements and proximal portions were added. For rib groups, counts were multiplied by the number of ribs in the group.For disarticulated innominates, os coxae counts were added to the largest counts of innominate bones on each side (left = ischium, right = ischium/pubis)."
